###River Levels

Being based in Dunkeswell, East Devon, I have not been able to escape the floods caused by the recent rainfall.

Nor have my friends and neighbours.

The [Environment Agency](http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/homeandleisure/floods/riverlevels/120722.aspx) has a great website which provides timely information on rever levels, but I thought it would be useful to tweet this
information which has been a terrific help, but it's not really designed for use on your phone.

To get around this I've created an application which tweets river level information as it updates, so that it is available to you on your smart phone.

If you or your business are using the service to save time or money then please spread the word by retweeting us.
